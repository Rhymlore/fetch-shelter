# Fetch Dog Shelter

Fetch Dog Shelter is a React web application designed to help dog lovers find and adopt dogs from shelters. The site allows users to search through a database of shelter dogs, with various filters and sorting options to aid in finding the perfect match. This project was bootstrapped with Create React App and utilizes Material-UI for styling.

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rhymlore/fetch-shelter.git

### Navigate to the project directory:

cd fetch-shelter

### Install dependencies:

npm install

## Running the Application

In the project directory, you can run:

### npm start
Runs the app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### npm test
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

### npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!

### npm run eject
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can’t go back!

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them.
